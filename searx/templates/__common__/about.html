  <h2>Why use searx?</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Searx may not offer you as personalised results as Google, but it doesn't
      generate a profile about you.
    </li>
    <li>
      Searx doesn't care about what you search for, never shares anything with a
      third party, and it can't be used to compromise you.
    </li>
    <li>
      Searx is free software, the code is 100% open and you can help to make it
      better.  See more on <a href="https://github.com/asciimoo/searx">github</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you do care about privacy, want to be a conscious user, or otherwise
    believe in digital freedom, make searx your default search engine or run it
    on your own server
  </p>

  <h2>Technical details - How does it work?</h2>

  <p>
    Searx is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasearch_engine">metasearch engine</a>,
    inspired by the <a href="https://beniz.github.io/seeks/">seeks project</a>.

    It provides basic privacy by mixing your queries with searches on other
    platforms without storing search data. Queries are made using a POST request
    on every browser (except chrome*).  Therefore they show up in neither our
    logs, nor your url history.  In case of Chrome* users there is an exception,
    searx uses the search bar to perform GET requests.

    Searx can be added to your browser's search bar; moreover, it can be set as
    the default search engine.
  </p>

  <h2 id='add to browser'>How to set as the default search engine?</h2>

  <p>
    Searx supports <a href="https://github.com/dewitt/opensearch/blob/master/opensearch-1-1-draft-6.md">OpenSearch</a>.
    For more information on changing your default search engine, see your browser's documentation:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-or-remove-search-engine-firefox">Firefox</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028574/microsoft-edge-change-the-default-search-engine" >Microsoft Egde</a></li>
    <li>Chrome based browsers <a href="https://www.chromium.org/tab-to-search">only add websites that the user navigates to without a path.</a>
  </ul>
