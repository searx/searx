For all the details, follow this `step by step
installation <https://github.com/asciimoo/searx/wiki/Installation>`__

Alternative (Recommended) Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  clone source:
   ``git clone git@github.com:asciimoo/searx.git && cd searx``
-  build in current folder: ``make minimal``
-  run ``bin/searx-run`` to start the application

Development
~~~~~~~~~~~

Just run ``make``. Versions of dependencies are pinned down inside
``versions.cfg`` to produce most stable build. Also remember, NO make
command should be run as root, not even ``make production``

Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~

-  clone source:
   ``git clone git@github.com:asciimoo/searx.git && cd searx``
-  build in current folder: ``make production``
-  run ``bin/supervisord`` to start the application

Upgrading
~~~~~~~~~

-  inside previously cloned searx directory run: ``git stash`` to
   temporarily save any changes you have made
-  pull source: ``git pull origin master``
-  re-build in current folder: ``make production``
-  run ``bin/supervisorctl stop searx`` to stop searx, if it does not,
   then run ``fuser -k 8888/tcp``
-  run ``bin/supervisorctl reload`` to re-read supervisor config and
   start searx

Command make
~~~~~~~~~~~~

``make``
''''''''

Builds development environment with testing support.

``make tests``
''''''''''''''

Runs tests. You can write tests
`here <https://github.com/asciimoo/searx/tree/master/searx/tests>`__ and
remember 'untested code is broken code'.

``make robot``
''''''''''''''

Runs robot (Selenium) tests, you must have ``firefox`` installed because
this functional tests actually run the browser and perform operations on
it. Also searx is executed with
`settings\_robot <https://github.com/asciimoo/searx/blob/master/searx/settings_robot.py>`__.

``make flake8``
'''''''''''''''

'pep8 is a tool to check your Python code against some of the style
conventions in `PEP 8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`__.'

``make coverage``
'''''''''''''''''

Checks coverage of tests, after running this, execute this:
``firefox ./coverage/index.html``

``make production``
'''''''''''''''''''

Used to make co-called production environment - without tests (you
should ran tests before deploying searx on the server). This installs
supervisord, so if searx crashes, it will try to pick itself up again.
And crontab entry is added to start supervisord at server boot.

``make minimal``
''''''''''''''''

Minimal build - without test frameworks, the quickest build option.

``make clean``
''''''''''''''

Deletes several folders and files (see ``Makefile`` for more), so that
next time you run any other ``make`` command it will rebuild everithing.

TODO
~~~~

-  Moar engines
-  Better ui
-  Browser integration
-  Documentation
-  Fix ``flake8`` errors, ``make flake8`` will be merged into
   ``make tests`` when it does not fail anymore
-  Tests
-  When we have more tests, we can integrate Travis-CI
