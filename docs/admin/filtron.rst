Searx depends on external search services.  To avoid the abuse of these services
it is advised to limit the number of requests processed by searx.

An application firewall, filtron_ solves exactly this problem.  Filtron is just
a middleware between your web server (nginx, apache, ...) and searx, we describe
such infratructures in chapter: :ref:`architecture`.


filtron & go
============

.. _Go: https://golang.org/
.. _filtron README: https://github.com/asciimoo/filtron/blob/master/README.md

Filtron needs Go_ installed.  If Go_ is preinstalled, filtron_ is simply
installed by ``go get`` package management (see `filtron README`_).  If you use
filtron as middleware, a more isolated setup is recommended.  To simplify such
an installation and the maintenance of, use our script :ref:`filtron.sh`.

.. _Sample configuration of filtron:

Sample configuration of filtron
===============================

.. sidebar:: Tooling box

   - :origin:`/etc/filtron/rules.json <utils/templates/etc/filtron/rules.json>`

An example configuration can be find below. This configuration limits the access
of:

- scripts or applications (roboagent limit)
- webcrawlers (botlimit)
- IPs which send too many requests (IP limit)
- too many json, csv, etc. requests (rss/json limit)
- the same UserAgent of if too many requests (useragent limit)

.. _filtron route request:

Route request through filtron
=============================

.. sidebar:: further reading

   - :ref:`filtron.sh overview`
   - :ref:`installation nginx`
   - :ref:`installation apache`

Filtron can be started using the following command:

.. code:: sh

   $ filtron -rules rules.json

It listens on ``127.0.0.1:4004`` and forwards filtered requests to
``127.0.0.1:8888`` by default.

Use it along with ``nginx`` with the following example configuration.

.. code:: nginx

   # https://example.org/searx

   location /searx {
       proxy_pass         http://127.0.0.1:4004/;

       proxy_set_header   Host             $host;
       proxy_set_header   Connection       $http_connection;
       proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP        $remote_addr;
       proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For  $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
       proxy_set_header   X-Scheme         $scheme;
       proxy_set_header   X-Script-Name    /searx;
   }

   location /searx/static {
       /usr/local/searx/searx-src/searx/static;
   }


Requests are coming from port 4004 going through filtron and then forwarded to
port 8888 where a searx is being run. For a complete setup see: :ref:`nginx
searx site`.
