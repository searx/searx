Search syntax
=============

Searx allows you to modify the default categories, engines and search language
via the search query.

Prefix ``!``
  to set Category/engine

Prefix: ``:``
  to set language

Prefix: ``?``
  to add engines and categories to the currently selected categories

Abbrevations of the engines and languages are also accepted.  Engine/category
modifiers are chainable and inclusive (e.g. with :search:`!it !ddg !wp qwer
<?q=%21it%20%21ddg%20%21wp%20qwer>` search in IT category **and** duckduckgo
**and** wikipedia for ``qwer``).

See the :search:`/preferences page <preferences>` for the list of engines,
categories and languages.
